# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

**a = 16
binary_representation = bin(a)
print(binary_representation)
**


## Output

<img width="1601" height="416" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4456c8db-92e2-4b98-9bf3-17953277b820" />


## Result
A Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions is excuted sucessful.
